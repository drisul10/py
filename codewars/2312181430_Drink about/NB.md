# NB

A very straighforward solution from me using `if-elif` and a guard clause. The best solution is using `if` and a guard clause.

## Keys

* Python uses indentation instead of curly braces, with the standard indentation being 4 spaces. See: [Peps Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#code-lay-out)
* How to write if-statement in Python: `if <condition> : return <value>`
* Python uses `elif`, whereas many programming languages use `else if`.
